After procrastinating for quite awhile, I am proud to say that I have finally build my personal website! 

Previously, I have always wanted to work on my personal website, but I can never seem to settle down on the tools to use. I was struggling to decide on whether I should build everything from scratch or use a CMS. And if I were to opt for a CMS, I was unsure if I should choose **KeystoneJS or WordPress**.

However, after browsing through on what **Jekyll** has to offer, I managed to make up my mind. So far, I am pretty impressed by the features offered and it is a perfect tool for a minimalist like me. Ease of customisation and extensibility was definitely a huge part of my consideration. On top of that, there is nothing more awesome than writing in **Markdown**.

Currently, I have incorporated **Bootstrap** to handle some of the frontend design. Other than some minor tweaks, I have yet to make much changes to the overall design. I was hoping to pen down some of the features that I would like to include in the near future.

So far, these are some of my thoughts:
- Showcase my involvement in past projects
- Categorise blog posts into sections, which can be related to school or software development
- Include the estimated time needed to read a blog post

Amongst the list of features, I will probably priortise the **projects' page** so that I can share some interesting work. After that, I can move on with the rest of the features. In the meantime, I shall refine the frontend design whenever I can afford some spare time.

Feeling so accomplished after planning out these tasks!
