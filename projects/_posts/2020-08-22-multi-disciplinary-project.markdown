#### Description
For this project, students were randomly allocated into a group of 8 members,
where 7 members were from Computer Science and the last member was from Computer
Engineering. We are expected to design an **autonomous robot** that is capable
of navigating across a maze filled with obstacles. At the same time, the robot
needs to identify images scattered around the maze. For more information on this
project, please **refer** to the video.

I was appointed as the leader for this project, where I needed to identify potential blockers 
and ensure that timelines could still be met. Aside from my own component, I needed 
to guide my team members whenever they faced any technical problems in their respective 
components.
