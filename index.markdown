I am currently a Computer Science undergraduate at **Nanyang Technological University**.

On a daily basis, I spend some of my time reading articles on [Medium](https://medium.com). 
I typically find interesting articles pertaining to personal development because I perceive 
it as an opportunity for me to reflect and improve my personal well-being.

Most recently, I have been taking some time off to experiment with **CI/CD pipeline** using some 
example projects. If I have additional time in my schedule, I definitely hope to get my hands dirty 
on **Kubernetes and other CNCF projects**.

If you have anything to share, I would like to hear them!
